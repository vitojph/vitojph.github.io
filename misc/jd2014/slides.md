### Motivation

- As the number of Internet users grows, more non-English speakers have access to the Web.

- The language gap is the first barrier and MLIA technology can facilitate accessing, querying and retrieving information from multiple sources and across languages.

- Searching for information is an eminently interactive process, but advances achieved in automatic IR have not yet been proved successful with real users.

- How can we properly assist people to find and use information expressed in unknown languages?



--SLIDE--
### Goals

<br/>

- To study and understand how the change from a monolingual to a multilingual environment modifies people’s performance, behavior and satisfaction when searching for information.

--SUBSLIDE--
### Interactive document retrieval is not a complete task

<br/>

- how many documents chosen by the user are relevant for the query? but;

- we cannot confirm that users were actually able to fulfill the initial information need

--SUBSLIDE--
### Beyond document retrieval

<br/>

- **interactive question answering**

  - brief passages vs. full documents
  - pre-specifying the expected type of answer can help users?
  - automatic highlighting of the possible target answers is useful?

--SUBSLIDE--

- **interactive image search**

  - are users willing to translate into unknown languages?
  - competence in target language determines the success of the task?
  - actual usage of CL facilities vs. subjects’ perception of usefulness

--SUBSLIDE--

<br/>

The conclusions of these analyses will allow us to propose mechanisms, tools and good practices to better assist users when searching for information in unknown languages.

### Hypothesis

- In monolingual information access tasks user’s intelligence compensates for system’s lacks.

- A user can easily learn how to use information retrieval’s interactive functionalities.

- In a CL environment, the user cannot adapt herself to a new language.

- Unable to search in unknown languages unless CL functionalities are provided by the system.

--SUBSLIDE--

### Hypothesis

<br/>

- in interactive cross-lingual information access tasks, the **cross-language facilities are the key factor** to explain people’s performance, behavior and experience.


--SLIDE--
### Methodology

- Conduct interactive QA experiments in a controlled CL scenario to provide evidence about the difficulties of searching answers.

- Test the usefulness of different access methods and search functionalities:

  - passages vs. documents.
  - automatic highlighting of potential expected answers.

--SUBSLIDE--

- Conduct interactive search experiments in a naturally multilingual images database: Flickr.

  - User-centered experiments in laboratory conditions aimed to test how CL technologies could enhance access

  - Explore the user interaction resulting from this.

--SUBSLIDE--

- Propose an image search task as a game.

  - Design a transaction log to capture every single detail of the multilingual
image search process.

  - Build a multilingual search interface for Flickr, supporting the collection of a medium size search log of multilingual image searches.

  - Apply transaction log analysis to understan the complete multilingual search processes from a user’s perspective.

### Results

- Passages preferred over documents, but documents are more effective  (López-Ostenero et al., 2005; Peinado et al., 2006; López Ostenero et al., 2008).

- Specifying the expected type of answer before launching the query is helpful (López-Ostenero et al., 2005).

- Automatic highlighting of the possible target answers is useful (Peinado et al., 2006).

--SUBSLIDE--

- Users tend to avoid translating their queries and search for images tagged in unknown languages: (Artiles et al., 2009).

- User with active competence in the target language perform 18% better than users with no competence (Peinado et al., 2009a,b)

- Users with passive competence need more interactions (Peinado et al., 2009a,b).

--SUBSLIDE--

- Usage of CL facilities is low but higher than RF and is perceived as useful (Artiles et al., 2009; Peinado et al., 2009a,b).

- Usage of RF is remarkably low but successful users use it more often (Artiles et al., 2009; Peinado et al., 2009a,b).

- Re-usable resources: the [iCLEF search log](https://github.com/vitojph/iclef) (Peinado et al., 2008, 2009a,b).

### User's Perceptions

- when the search is in an unknown language, the language barrier is perceived as the most challenging aspect of the task.

- in the successful sessions (see Figure 13), the most frequent answer for profiles with skills in the annotation language of the target image were “It was easy”. Their main problems were to describe the image (option d) and the size of the image set (option b). On the other hand, the most common difficulty for those users without competence in the target language was exactly to know the annotation language.


Figure 13: Post-image questionnaire after a successful search session.
As far as the failed sessions are concerned (see Figure 14), the most common answers among all profiles were again how to find suitable query terms to describe the target image (option c) and how to handle a big set of results (option a).


### Most useful interface’s facilities

- more than 70% of the subjects found useful or very useful the automatic translation of the queries and the possibility of maintaining a personal dictionary with their preferred translation

- RF facilities were rated positively for about 5 and 61% of the subjects

--SUBSLIDE--

### Most useful interface’s facilities

![](img/questionnaires.png)


a. The automatic translation of query terms
b. The possibility of improving the translation chosen by the system
c. The additional query terms suggested by the system
d. The assistant to select new query terms from the set of results.
