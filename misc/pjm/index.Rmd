## A brief story

- In the mid-80s, there was a little kid who played with Lego computers...

- ... and pretended to speak foreign languages.

- I wanted to talk to computers. I wanted computers to talk to me.

- I want to help build Artifical Intelligence (AI).


## Artificial Intelligence

- AI implies Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

- HCI is far from perfect: people need to learn how to use machines.

- Natural language seems still a miracle.

- Natural Language Processing (NLP) can help AI to improve HCI.

- Figuring out how to communicate with computers in order to understand how our mind works.

- Great time for AI: Deep Learning


## NLP Tasks

- Machine Translation (MT).

- Information Retrieval (IR).

- Information Extraction (IE).

- Virtual Assistants.


## Teaching machines to act like humans

- Machine Learning (ML).

- Learn by examples: positive and negative cases.

- Computers can review millions of examples, can learn patterns and generalize.

- Once the computer has been trained, it can automatically classify a new example, never seen before.


## What can linguists do here?

- Encode linguistic knowledge and describe linguistic phenomena.

- Build linguistic resources.

- Test current systems and detect errors.



## Annotate Data for ML

- PoS tagging: grammatical categories and features.

- Syntax: dependency parsing (heads and modifiers).

- Semantic annotation: mentions, entities (types), co-reference chains.

- Specialized search engines: shopping, images


## Other tasks in which we participate

- Annotation of specialized lexicons:

    - weather

    - sports

    - flights

    - events

- Model different type of action types:

    - reminders
  
    - communication actions


## Unsupervised ML

- When we cannot model of knowledge (or it isn't feasible to manually annotate the data).

- Big data, analysis of raw data, *zillions* of unannotatede examples are processed.

- Computers detect patterns, extract by themselves the model.

- it works surprisingly well: it's (black) magic :-)

- Smart algorithms, but the whole process is becoming a black box.

Any questions??
